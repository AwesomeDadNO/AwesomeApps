 CineSync is a comprehensive media library management system designed to efficiently organize libraries for Movies & TV shows, eliminating the need for Sonarr/Radarr. With its modern web interface, real-time monitoring, and advanced automation features, CineSync streamlines the organization of your library while providing full control over your data locally. While highly optimized for debrid platforms, CineSync is also versatile and works effectively with non-debrid platforms.
